# How To Write Three.js Games

This pages is notes about how to do games with three.js.

From [github issue #53](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex/issues/53)

## How To Make Sounds

In Short, use [Web Audio API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html). 
You can use [WebAudiox](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/webaudiox) helpers if you want. It helps
a for for best practices and sounds localisations. So when a monster on my left yells i want to 
hear it on the left.

## How To Do UI

In Short, use the DOM itself for that. Dont recode it in canvas 2d or WebGL.
You can look at [marbletable2](http://jeromeetienne.github.io/marbletable2/).


## User Identification

Nothings specific is provided. 
Maybe good idea if you use external services for that, it avoid to redo the same thing
over and over. Maybe [passport.js](http://passportjs.org/) is a good idea.

## How to write a post processing extension

There are a few already
[threex.depthoffield](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.depthoffield)
[threex.coloradjust](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.coloradjust)
and
[threex.badtvpproc](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.badtvpproc)

If you have to copy one, copy ```threex.badtvpproc```. It is the most modern one. 

### Notes
* try to provide a datgui extension to help fine tuning. 
  Thus people can easily make it fit their own needs
* for an effect of *blast*, the filenames will be 
  * ```THREEx.BlastPasses``` for the passes to add ```THREE.EffectComposer```
  * ```THREEx.BlastDatgui``` for the dat.gui
  
## the why of startwithwhy

  He is saying 'do more than playing game, make one'
* three.js games is there to make game developement easier than ever
* anybody can write games
